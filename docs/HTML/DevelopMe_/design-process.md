# Design Process

## Design Methodologies

### Waterfall -
Every step occurs in order, one after the other. What tends to happen is the different steps will take longer than expected, leaving little time or budget for the actual development.

#### Typical waterfall process

- Get brief
- Sitemap / Information Architecture
- Review and sign-off
- Wireframing / Prototyping
- Review and sign-off
- Technical Specification
- Review and sign-off
- Design
- Review and sign-off
- Build
- Profit üí∞

### Agile -
More transparent process with ongoing client involvement. Small incremental designs, with development occurring for each phase of the project, called 'user stories'.

### Lean -
Small team, often a designer and developer working side by side. Not much client involvement.
 - Deigned for quick delivery and outcome, prioritises result above quality. - Ideal for startup companies, to present to users for testing. Often used for unknown ventures or new features.

### Kanban -
Breaking down the process into visual to-do management. Task focused.

### Scrum -

## Questions when starting a project

- Who are your users?
- What are they trying to do?
- What are the business aims
- What technologies are we going to use? Do they need to be able to support it in-house?
- What other systems does it need to work with?

Different people will use your site differently and for different purposes.

### Things to remember about your users

You are not your user.

#### You should:

- Try to understand who they are
- Plan for their needs
- Test for their typical behaviours

#### Questions to ask:

- What is this site for?
- Who are our users (name three)?
- What will they do?
- What technologies will they use?

## Scamping & Wireframing


### Articulates elements and layout

Start to think about:

- Content hierarchy on the page
- Layout + UI
- User journeys - how to get around
- Responsive behaviour


### No visual design

Literally just what is where & how it works

Crucially, a way of thinking about the content and behaviour **before visual design is considered.**

That‚Äôs why wireframes will look **bland and grey.**

We want to **focus on the function** of the site before we start thinking about style.

## Scamps

A quick sketch with a pen and paper

As you're discussing the site, just sketch it out

You can throw it out and start again easily

## Wireframes

### Think detail

Give to a designer to create designs from.
All elements & functionality.
Include notes and interaction.


### Pro tip

#### Explain what it is for

When sending a wireframe link to a client you should include an explanation of what a wireframe is for, what feedback is useful, and what isn‚Äôt

‚ÄúIt works well but I don‚Äôt like the grey‚Äù



### Pro tip

#### Explain what it‚Äôs for on the wireframe

Clients will circulate a wireframe link within the organisation, often without your helpful explanation of what a wireframe is for...

...so add the description to the wireframes front page!
