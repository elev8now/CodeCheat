# Photoshop to Web

## What to ask for?

-   Artwork file
-   Responsive designs
-   Fonts
-   Other assets (images, icons) - can export from artwork yourself
-   Media (videos, audio)
-   Animations, interactivity (hovers)
-   Expect lots of designs

## Different Program Files

-   Photoshop (PSD) - Will have layers to turn on and off access different elements separately.
-   InDesign (INDD) - Vector files, layers, copy text, fonts. May include source images (links).
-   Illustrator
-   Sketch (not Adobe, macOS only) - Super good at website & app. Vector based.

## Flat (Image) Files

-   PDFs Good, vector-based, usually not lossy compression, often can copy text.
-   PNGs Lossless.
-   JPGs Lossy compression, difficult to get clean image from. Potentially different ‘colourspace’.

When using Photoshop to design webpages, as a rule of thumb, measure the width of the page to approx. 1000px for average desktop devices, 700px for tablet devices, and 400px for mobile devices. You may want to design at 1500px to accommodate newer desktop devices, e.g. retina screens.

## Image formats

### Raster /  Bitmap

-   WEBP - best choice but not supported by all browsers
-   TIFF
-   JPG
-   PNG - these differ from jpg - they have an alpha channel, or transparency
-   GIF
-   BMP


### Vector

-   SVG - these tend to be icons or animations - drawing shapes with data coordinates

## Planning layout

### Create a blueprint

Sketch out and annotate, note dimensions, colours, repeated styles, fonts, naming for classes later.

Use:

-   Paper & pen (a lot!)
-   Whiteboard
-   Photoshop
