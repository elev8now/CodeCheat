# Prototyping

### Wireframing is good for:

-   Send to client
-   Comments & Discussions
-   Adjustments
-   Problems
-   Versions
-   Visualise & planning

### Wireframing doesn't give you:

-   Interactivity

> Without the usability of something it can be hard to visualise

### Solution? Prototypes!

> A _quick_ interactive workable solution

### Exercise:

Let's create a working prototype of a page

To do this we're going to use a CSS Framework

## Frameworks, libraries, APIs

### Library

A library is a collection of functions / objects that serves one particular purpose. You could use a library in a variety of projects.

Examples:

-   jquery
-   React
-   moment.js

### Framework

A framework is a collection of patterns and libraries to help with building an application.

Examples:

-   Bootstrap
-   Angular
-   Rails (by Ruby)

### API

An API is an interface for other programs to interact with your program without having direct access.

Examples:

-   Google Maps
-   Weather
-   Social networks e.g. My Latest Tweets is interacting with Twitter API

To put it another way, think of a library as an add-on / piece of an application, a framework as the skeleton of the application, and an API as an outward-facing part of said app.

### Tooling / Preprocessor

Tools that enable us to construct data. For example, SASS and SCSS are preprocessors because they help us to construct CSS.

A framework is a collection of patterns and libraries.

You can re-use the code you're writing. HTML is repetitive, for example, headers, navigation etc.

## Examples of CSS Frameworks

-   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
-   [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/)
-   [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
-   [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
-   [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/)
-   [Semantic](https://semantic-ui.com/)
-   [Pure](https://purecss.io/)
-   [Milligram](https://milligram.io/)

A framework is a collection of patterns, and reusable code.

## Where to use frameworks

Not every framework is good for every project

-   Prototyping
-   Docs
-   Quick win

## Why use a framework

-   So you don't have to do the work

## How

-   You include the code (probably a css file or files)
-   You use the given HTML.

### Start by reading the docs

<https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/>

### Bootstrap under the hood

<https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v4-dev/scss>

### Reason why it's good

-   Quicker (once you've learnt)
-   Work done for you
-   Kept up to date

### Reasons why it's bad

-   Tied into a system, 'breaking out' is more work
-   Bespoke styling is hard
-   No control over support
-   So. Much. Code!

### Exercise

-   Build a page with Bootstrap
-   Download it and include it
-   Read the docs and start adding HTML to your page
